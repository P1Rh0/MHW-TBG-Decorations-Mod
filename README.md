## Appraising feystones
You can roll a D6 to appraise the feystones. Each feystone will provide one decoration. Note that feystones can be freely traded, however decorations themselves cannot (or do, I’m not the boss of you, just have fun). Make sure you decide who is going to roll for each of your groups feystones as, once appraised, the decorations are yours forever!

## Armour slots
Decorations can be slotted into armour between fights. Use the table below to check the slots available on each armour piece. Note:
•	A level 2 decoration can only be used on an armour piece with a level 2 slot. 
•	Only one decoration can be used in each slot. For example you can’t put two level 1 decorations in a level 2 slot.
